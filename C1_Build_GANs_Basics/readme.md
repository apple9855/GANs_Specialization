- C1 : Build GANs Basics
1. Intro (Generator, Discriminator, Loss function, in PyTorch)
2. Deep Convolutional GANs (Activations, BatchNorm, Padding, Strides, Pooling, Upsampling, Transposed Convolution)
3. Wasserstein GANs with Gradient Penalty (Mode collapse, W-loss, Critie model, K-Lipschitz continuous, WGANs with gradient penalty)
4. Conditional GAN & Controllable Generation (v vectors add-up (one-hot) inputs, manipulate inputs, interpolation, latent spaces)
